             <h2>While completing the assignment I faced alot of problems. The hardest time I had was when I had to make a hamburger icon and hamburger menu. It was not taught to to us by our teacher in any of our classes whatsoever.So I had to resort to watching  videos in youtube and learn how to make it properly.Making new branches in github was also very foreign to me due to the same reason.</h2>
