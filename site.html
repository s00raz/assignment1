		    		 <h2> While  executing the assignment I had the opportunity to lean alot of things practically.To be honest there were things that I had to learn independently from other sources such as youtube and other websites.Most of the stuff that was Required to do was very foreign to me even though I was upto date with everthing that our teacher taught me.</h2>

           <h1>Ups and downs</h1>
             <h2>While completing the assignment I faced alot of problems. The hardest time I had was when I had to make a hamburger icon and hamburger menu. It was not taught to to us by our teacher in any of our classes whatsoever.So I had to resort to watching  videos in youtube and learn how to make it properly.Making new branches in github was also very foreign to me due to the same reason.I got to learn man uses of "checkbox" and label tags.</h2>

		      	 <h1> Navigation </h1>
		      	   <h1> On the top of the page is navigation bar. I have made a list using "ul" and "li" tag.I gave the the "nav" tag "display:flex" and the "ul" tag display:inline block to make it horizontal.I have used text shadow to give it a 3d effect. I have used transtion property to give it hover animation.However, I took  ideas on how to make this navigation bar from a youtube channel "JP Web".

		      <div class="home">
		      <h1>Home page</h1>
		      <h1>I wanted to make the home page very simple and welcoming. The background image was obtained from "#".[Accesed on]. I came u with the idea to animate each letter of "Welcome". i gave "text" class to each letter of the word.I gave it shadow effect and gave it animation by adding transition and hover.   </h1>
